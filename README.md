Important note : the model I used is based on kaggle's bag of words meets bags of popcorn competiton 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial
so the model isn't large enough to be 100% accurate,the larger the model gets the more space it will take, so I used 
a simple model which takes less storage.
